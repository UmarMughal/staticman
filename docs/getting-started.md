Welcome! These instructions show you how to integrate Staticman with your site.

These steps relate to the hosted version of the platform; if you wish to host it yourself on your infrastructure, check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman).

## Step 1. Add Staticman to your repository

I will need push access to the repositories you want me to commit the files to. In GitHub, go to your repository **Settings** page, navigate to the **Collaborators** tab and add the username **staticmanapp**.

At this point, the invitation will be pending. In order for me to accept it, you need to open:

`https://api.staticman.net/v1/connect/{your GitHub username}/{your repository name}`

If all goes well, you should receive a message saying **OK!** and we're good to go.

## Step 2. Add Staticman to your Jekyll config file

I will look for a `_config.yml` file in the root of the repository. Inside, I will read certain settings from a `staticman` object â€” things like whether to enable content moderation, spam protection, the format or the path of the data files.

[This list](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman#jekyll-configuration) contains a list of all configurable parameters.

## Step 3. Hook up your forms

Forms should `POST` to:

`https://api.staticman.net/v1/entry/{your GitHub repository}/{your repository name}/{the name of the branch}`

All fields should be nested under a `fields` array. Optionally, a `options` array can be used to pass along additional information, such as the title of a post.

The following markup shows how the form for a simple commenting system would look like:

{% highlight html %}{% raw %}
<form method="POST" action="https://api.staticman.net/v1/entry/eduardoboucas/staticman/gh-pages">
  <!-- e.g. "2016-01-02-this-is-a-post" -->
  <input name="options[slug]" type="hidden" value="{{ page.slug }}">

  <input name="fields[name]" type="text">
  <input name="fields[email]" type="email">
  <textarea name="fields[message]"></textarea>

  <button type="submit">Go!</button>
</form>
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

## Step 4. Approve entries (optional)

If you enable content moderation (by setting `moderation: true` in the config), I will send a pull request whenever a new entry is submitted. Merge the pull request to approve it, or close to discard.

Please note that this step will be skipped if you disable moderation, as entries will be pushed to the main branch immediately.
